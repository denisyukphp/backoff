Back-off algorithm implementation.

## Installation

You can install the latest version via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```text
composer require orangesoft/backoff
```

This package requires PHP 7.2 or later.

## Quick usage

Configure BackOff and ExceptionClassifier to retry your business logic when an exception will be thrown:

```php
<?php

use Orangesoft\BackOff\Facade\ExponentialBackOff;
use Orangesoft\BackOff\Retry\ExceptionClassifier\ExceptionClassifier;
use Orangesoft\BackOff\Retry\Retry;

$maxAttempts = 3;
$baseTimeMs = 1000;

$backOff = new ExponentialBackOff($maxAttempts, $baseTimeMs);

$classifier = new ExceptionClassifier([
    \RuntimeException::class,
]);

$retry = new Retry($backOff, $classifier);
```

Put the business logic in a callback function and call it:

```php
$retry->call(function (): int {
    $random = mt_rand(5, 10);
    
    if (0 === $random % 2) {
        throw new \RuntimeException();
    }
    
    return $random;
});
```

After the exception is thrown call will be retried with a back-off time until max attempts has been reached.
